          <p>
            JavaScript variables, when declared using `var`, have function
            scope, making them accessible throughout the entire function,
            including within conditional blocks and loops. They are also hoisted
            to the top of their containing function. In contrast, `let` and
            `const` introduce block scope, confining their accessibility to the
            block in which they are defined, such as a function, loop, or `if`
            statement. `let` and `const` variables are not hoisted, and
            accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
            `const` additionally enforces a constant value after initialization,
            promoting safer coding practices. In modern JavaScript, `let` and
            `const` are preferred for their well-defined scoping rules, while
            `var` is used less frequently due to its less predictable function
            scope and hoisting behavior.

          <p>
            In JavaScript, both `null` and `undefined` serve specific purposes
            in handling the absence of values. `null` is typically employed when
            you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or property has no
            value or that you've intentionally assigned it to represent
            "nothing." It can be a deliberate choice to signify the absence of a
            meaningful value in your code. On the other hand, `undefined` often
            arises as the default value for variables that have not been
            initialized or for properties that do not exist in an object. It can
            also indicate the absence of a return value from a function when no
            value is explicitly returned. Understanding when to use `null` and
            when `undefined` occurs naturally is essential for writing clean and
            robust JavaScript code, as it helps convey the intended state of
            your program's data.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application
            Programming Interface, is a fundamental architectural style for
            designing web services that interact with each other over the
            internet. It adheres to a set of principles and constraints that
            emphasize simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP
            protocol. In a RESTful API, resources are central, identified by
            unique URIs, and manipulated using standard HTTP methods like GET,
            POST, PUT, and DELETE, making it a robust foundation for creating
            CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. One key
            characteristic of REST is its statelessness, meaning each request
            from a client to a server contains all the necessary information,
            and the server doesn't rely on past interactions. Additionally, REST
            APIs support multiple data representations, making them versatile
            for various client needs. This architectural style has gained
            widespread adoption due to its effectiveness in enabling different
            applications and systems to communicate seamlessly and share
            resources on the web while maintaining a clear and organized
            structure.
